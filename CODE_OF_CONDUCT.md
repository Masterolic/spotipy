## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project contributors are resposinble for making sure their contributions to the project align with the values and standards set forth.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors, whether public or privately so long as they are acting at the behest of the project. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project owners. These reports will be reviewed and investigated, followed by an adequate response to the situation. The project owners will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project contributors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith will be punished accordingly by the project owners.
