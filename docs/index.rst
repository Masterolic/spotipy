Welcome to Spotipy!
===================================

*Spotipy* is a lightweight Python library for the `Spotify Web API
<https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/>`_. With *Spotipy*
you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.

Assuming you set the ``SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`` and ``SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET``
environment variables (here is a `video <https://youtu.be/kaBVN8uP358>`_ explaining how to do so). For a longer tutorial with examples included, refer to this `video playlist <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmt5SdvTqUI&list=PLqgOPibB_QnzzcaOFYmY2cQjs35y0is9N&index=1>`_. Below is a quick example of using *Spotipy* to list the
names of all the albums released by the artist 'Birdy'::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    birdy_uri = 'spotify:artist:2WX2uTcsvV5OnS0inACecP'
    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())

    results = spotify.artist_albums(birdy_uri, album_type='album')
    albums = results['items']
    while results['next']:
        results = spotify.next(results)
        albums.extend(results['items'])

    for album in albums:
        print(album['name'])

Here's another example showing how to get 30 second samples and cover art
for the top 10 tracks for Led Zeppelin::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    lz_uri = 'spotify:artist:36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp'

    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())
    results = spotify.artist_top_tracks(lz_uri)

    for track in results['tracks'][:10]:
        print('track    : ' + track['name'])
        print('audio    : ' + track['preview_url'])
        print('cover art: ' + track['album']['images'][0]['url'])
        print()

Finally, here's an example that will get the URL for an artist image given the
artist's name::

    import spotipy
    import sys
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    spotify = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials())

    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        name = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    else:
        name = 'Radiohead'

    results = spotify.search(q='artist:' + name, type='artist')
    items = results['artists']['items']
    if len(items) > 0:
        artist = items[0]
        print(artist['name'], artist['images'][0]['url'])

Getting Started with Spotipy
===============

Before you can use Spotipy, there are a few things you need to do:

Register your app: To make authorized calls to the Spotify Web API, you need to register your app and obtain a client ID and client secret. You can register your app at My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>_. Make sure to keep your client ID and client secret secure.

Choose an authorization flow: Spotipy supports two authorization flows: the Authorization Code flow and the Client Credentials flow. Choose the one that's suitable for your application.
  - **Authorization Code flow** This method is suitable for long-running applications
    which the user logs into once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed.

   .. note:: This method requires you to add a redirect URI to your application at 
              `My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>`_.
              See `Redirect URI`_ for more details.

  - **The Client Credentials flow** This is suitable for short-lived applications that don't require user permission. It makes it possible to authenticate your requests to the Spotify Web API and to obtain a higher rate limit than you would with the Authorization Code flow.

Before you can use Spotipy's methods, you need to authorize your app by registering it at My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>_. This will give you a *client id* and *client secret* that you'll need to use in your code.


Authorization Code Flow
=======================

This flow is suitable for long-running applications in which the user grants
permission only once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed.
Since the token exchange involves sending your secret key, perform this on a
secure location, like a backend service, and not from a client such as a
browser or from a mobile app.

Quick start
-----------

To support the **Client Authorization Code Flow** *Spotipy* provides a
class SpotifyOAuth that can be used to authenticate requests like so::

    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

    scope = "user-library-read"

    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(scope=scope))

    results = sp.current_user_saved_tracks()
    for idx, item in enumerate(results['items']):
        track = item['track']
        print(idx, track['artists'][0]['name'], " â€“ ", track['name'])

or if you are reluctant to immortalize your app credentials in your source code,
you can set environment variables like so (use ``$env:"credentials"`` instead of ``export``
on Windows)::

    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
    export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='your-app-redirect-url'

Scopes
------

See `Using
Scopes <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes/>`_ for information
about scopes.

Redirect URI
------------

The **Authorization Code Flow** needs you to add a **redirect URI**
to your application at 
`My Dashboard <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>`_
(navigate to your application and then *[Edit Settings]*).

The ``redirect_uri`` argument or ``SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`` environment variable
must match the redirect URI added to your application in your Dashboard.
The redirect URI can be any valid URI (it does not need to be accessible)
such as ``http://example.com``, ``http://localhost`` or ``http://127.0.0.1:9090``.

    .. note:: If you choose an `http`-scheme URL, and it's for `localhost` or
     `127.0.0.1`, **AND** it specifies a port, then spotipy will instantiate
      a server on the indicated response to receive the access token from the
      response at the end of the oauth flow [see the code](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/oauth2.py#L483-L490).


Client Credentials Flow
=======================

The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Only
endpoints that do not access user information can be accessed. The advantage here
in comparison with requests to the Web API made without an access token,
is that a higher rate limit is applied.

As opposed to the Authorization Code Flow, you will not need to set ``SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI``,
which means you will never be redirected to the sign in page in your browser::

    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'

To support the **Client Credentials Flow** *Spotipy* provides a
class SpotifyClientCredentials that can be used to authenticate requests like so::


    import spotipy
    from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

    auth_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials()
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=auth_manager)

    playlists = sp.user_playlists('spotify')
    while playlists:
        for i, playlist in enumerate(playlists['items']):
            print("%4d %s %s" % (i + 1 + playlists['offset'], playlist['uri'],  playlist['name']))
        if playlists['next']:
            playlists = sp.next(playlists)
        else:
            playlists = None


IDs URIs and URLs
=================

*Spotipy* supports a number of different ID types:

  - **Spotify URI** - The resource identifier that you can enter, for example, in
    the Spotify Desktop client's search box to locate an artist, album, or
    track. Example: ``spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``
  - **Spotify URL** - An HTML link that opens a track, album, app, playlist or other
    Spotify resource in a Spotify client. Example:
    ``http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``
  - **Spotify ID** - A base-62 number that you can find at the end of the Spotify
    URI (see above) for an artist, track, album, etc. Example:
    ``6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6``

In general, any *Spotipy* method that needs an artist, album, track or playlist ID
will accept ids in any of the above form


Customized token caching
========================

Tokens are refreshed automatically and stored by default in the project main folder.
As this might not suit everyone's needs, spotipy provides a way to create customized
cache handlers.

https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/cache_handler.py

The custom cache handler would need to be a class that inherits from the base
cache handler ``CacheHandler``. The default cache handler ``CacheFileHandler`` is a good example.
An instance of that new class can then be passed as a parameter when
creating ``SpotifyOAuth``, ``SpotifyPKCE`` or ``SpotifyImplicitGrant``.
The following handlers are available and defined in the URL above.
  - ``CacheFileHandler``
  - ``MemoryCacheHandler``
  - ``DjangoSessionCacheHandler``
  - ``FlaskSessionCacheHandler``
  - ``RedisCacheHandler``

Feel free to contribute new cache handlers to the repo.

Troubleshooting
=======

This section aims to address common issues that users may encounter while working with Spotipy and provide practical solutions to resolve them.

**Authentication errors**: Make sure that you have correctly set up your credentials and are using the correct authorization flow to avoid authenthication erros. Ensure that your client ID and client secret are correct and that you have added the appropriate redirect URIs to your Spotify Developer Dashboard.

**Playlist creation errors**: If you're having trouble creating a playlist, check that your user ID is correct, and that the user has the necessary permissions to create playlists. Additionally, make sure that your code is formatted correctly, along with the fact that you are sending the appropriate request to the Spotify API.

**Search errors**: If you're having problems when searching for music, make sure that you are providing the correct search query parameters. You should also check the Spotify API documentation to ensure that the endpoint you're using supports the search parameters you are providing.

**API changes**: Sometimes the Spotify API may change, causing errors in your application. To fix this, check the Spotify API documentation to see if there are any changes that may affect your code and update it accordingly.

**Rate limiting**: Making too many requests to the Spotify API within a short period of time, will result in you hitting the rate limit. To prevent this, use caching and backoff mechanisms in your code

**Authorization errors**: If you encounter authorization errors, make sure that you have correctly set up your credentials and are using the correct authorization flow. You may also need to check if your access token has expired and obtain a new one if necessary.
